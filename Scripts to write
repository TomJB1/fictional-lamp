Write any scripts that need to be written or behaviors ext that need to be written
If you start working on something add W and then your initial (for example WT) in front
of the line. When finished add D in front (delete the W) and write the names of any files 
that were edited then add them to github. The other person will then edit their copy of the
file to match it. When editing a script in unity, add a comment that says NEW above and below
any new code.

   Do first:
Movement
Weapons and armour system ( with weapon and armour changing at save points.)
Room system
Save system ( with lit and unlit fires )
Map system

   Mob Ais:
Normal 'patrolling' mob ai
Fairy ai ( flies to hight of player then rapidly shoots magic bolts)

   Boss ai:
Giant ai ( remember will be in castle )
Angel ai ( flies )
Underground blob ( maybe with different phases )
Half fish ( shoots bubbles )
Demon ( zaps player into another dimension temporarily )
Fire Wizard ( final Boss, multiple phases, dash through you turning into fire)
